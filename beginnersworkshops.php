			Beginners Workshops

		<h3>
			Complete one of our Beginners Workshops to learn the basics before you join our Nordic Walks.  
		</h3>
		<p>
			They are a fun 2 hour session (please allow 2.5hrs). During this session you will learn the basics of how to Nordic Walk.  You won't need anything as such for this course as poles are provided.  Just turn up in clothing to suit the weather, we advise trainers rather than walking boots.
		</p>
		<p>
			﻿Your tuition doesn't stop there though, once you have completed a Workshop you will then be able to join our walks where you will receive instruction to continue to improve and perfect your technique so that you can get the full benefits of Nordic Walking.  All workshops are currently held at Trelissick Gardens.
