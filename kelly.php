			I began Nordic Walking over 3 years ago.  I had had enough of being overweight and not having the energy to enjoy my life. Diets alone didn't work for me and I hated gyms and classes as being overweight I was very self conscious.
			<br />I found a Nordic Walking group and before long I decided that I really enjoyed Nordic Walking.....it wasn't a race, there was no competition and no one was looking at me thinking how awful I looked because we were all too busy out enjoying ourselves walking and talking. Not only was it good for my confidence and health I found that I was getting some "me" time too, being a mum I needed a break now and again and didn't realise it. I decided to buy a set of really nice poles, I wanted to make sure I kept  on Nordic Walking so I thought if I buy these poles I will HAVE to use them. I then started to calorie count alongside the Nordic Walking and the weight began to fall off. I walked twice a week for roughly an hour each time. In about 8 months I had lost a total of 4 stone. I went from squeezing into a size 16 to a trim size 10/12.
			The poles, that I still use now, were such a great investment in ME.
			<br />I hope you will enjoy Nordic Walking as much as I do and can benefit from it as much as I have and still do.
