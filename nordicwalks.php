			Nordic Walks
		</h1>
		<p>
			We Nordic Walk in the most beautiful places in Cornwall.  
		</p>
		<p>
			 All walks are of an average speed (unless both Instructor and Walk Leader are present when we are able to have a faster and slower group). If you feel you want to walk faster you will be able to go ahead and then return to the group giving yourself a longer walk please notify your Instructor/Walk Leader if you will be doing this. If you need to stop at anytime this is not a problem just let your Instructor/Walk Leader know that you have stopped.​​ 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Nordic Walking Checklist....</strong> water &amp; water carrier, small snack, layered clothing, waterproofs, trainers, any medication you may need eg inhaler and finally poles if not using Walk Kernow poles.
		﻿</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Time....</strong> Please be aware that we do try to start the walks on time.  Please arrive at least 10 minutes before the start of the walk to give yourself time to get your kit ready and sign in.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Parking ....</strong> We try to make sure that we use either free or National Trust Car Parks. (NT £3 per month permit now available please ask your Instructor or Walk Leader for more information).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Refreshments....</strong> All our day time and weekend walks have refreshment facilities near to the start/end of the walk.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are adding new Nordic Walks all the time so if you know of a great walk please let us know!
