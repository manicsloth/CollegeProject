			About...
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is a real feast for the eyes with stunning views and lots of fresh air.  This walk may have to change venue if there is a strong offshore wind or if the weather is particularly bad. We usually relocate to Tehidy Woods. This walk is along the cliffs on the South West Coastal Path and involves some steep hills.
			<br /><br /><strong>DOGS ARE NOT PERMITTED ON THIS WALK</strong>
			<br /><br />If you are not sure if this walk is suitable for you please ask.
			<br /><br />Approx 2hrs
