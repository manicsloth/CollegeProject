			What is Nordic Walking?​
		</h1>

		<p>
			Nordic Walking uses specially designed poles to enhance your natural walking experience.  With a technique that is similar to the upper body action of classic cross country skiing, Nordic Walking becomes a genuinely whole body exercise that can be enjoyed at many levels, from walking for health to athletic Nordic running.  More than 10 million people globally enjoy this outdoor activity all year round.

			Nordic Walking is a very accessible activity and something that can be shared by people of different fitness levels.  It’s an ideal activity for people who haven’t exercised for a while or who dislike traditional sports or gym activities.  An injured person can use the poles to support and guide, working to improve fitness as part of their rehabilitation.  Athletes can use Nordic Walking for cross training and incorporate Nordic running.  If you’d like to shed a few pounds, then Nordic Walking is an enjoyable way to do this.  It’s great for fitness enthusiasts who like to try new things.  Whatever your age from 8 to 80+, you’'ll probably enjoy discovering the benefits of Nordic Walking that improve your quality of life.
