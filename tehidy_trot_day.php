			About...
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is a lovely walk through the woods at Tehidy.  Each time we walk here we try to take a different route and as there are over 9 miles of pathway through the woods we have plenty to choose from. This walk can be muddy in places. Dogs, horses and bikes use the woods too.
			<br /><br /><strong>WELL BEHAVED DOGS ARE WELCOME ON THIS WALK</strong>
			<br /><br />If you are not sure if this walk is suitable for you please ask.
			<br /><br />Approx 2 hours
