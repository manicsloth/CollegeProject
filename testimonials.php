			"One of the best things I ever did was reply to the walk kernow advert I saw on network cornwall. I have been going for a long time now and a nordic walk with the group never ceases to make me happy, de-stress, and invigorate me. A good time guaranteed! Not forgetting the coffees!"

			"I started Nordic Walking with Walk Kernow in 2012. I love it - and can't recommend it highly enough. Kelly will put you at your ease - you will get fit and meet a lovely bunch of friends. Try it - you will be hooked! 11/10"

			"Walk Kernow Nordic Walking was recommended to me by a very dear friend who had already been coming to walks for a little while. That said, it still took me a little while to build up the confidence to try this as i was unsure about about joining a group as i knew as a newbie i would start completely on my own. However once I had arrived for the beginner workshop Kelly and Suzanne immediately made me feel welcome, valued and totally at ease. By the end of that first session I was totally hooked and couldn't wait to Nordic Walk again! I have problems with my back that can at times severely hamper my ability to exercise, especially walking but with the poles and expert guidance and support, I'm finding that I can easily manage a good paced walk of at least four miles (slowly building up to more) and have noticed a massive boost in my back health, confidence, well being and general health all round. Walks are always fun, interesting and open for lively conversation or quiet contemplation and always with lovely company. In my opinion this is without a doubt THE perfect way to exercise and socialise at the same time".

			“The workshop I did a few weeks ago with Kelly was great. I've been out on a few of her walks since and its so nice to be exercising out in the open whilst having a natter with new walking friends. Such an inexpensive work out too, and beats going to the gym!”

			“Kelly is a great instructor and I have thoroughly enjoyed the Workshop and Walk at Trelissick and the Pandora Inn Walk on the weekend. I agree with everything the others have said - it's a great way to exercise, I feel inspired to walk more, I feel fitter and more energised in everything I do.  Would recommend Nordic Walking to everyone!”
