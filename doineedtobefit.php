			If you can walk, you can Nordic walk!
		</h1>

		<p>
			Nordic Walking really is for everyone. The poles mean that effort is shared between the upper and lower body and it actually feels easier than normal walking, particularly uphill.  It's really good exercise for problem areas such as the arms, stomach and bottom. But forget 'No pain no gain', this is 'No pain all gain'!  Nordic Walking puts less strain on joints than other activities and can be very effective for people with mobility issues or those recovering from illness or injury.

			It's also not all about speed, walking a little slower is a great calorie burner whilst walking faster increases your fitness. Walk Kernow provides Nordic Walks for everyone!
