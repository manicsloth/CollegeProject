			Suzanne Allin
			<br />BNW Walk Leader

		</h1>
		<p>
			Suzanne started Nordic Walking to help her lose weight and get fit prior to her 5 year medical to renew her sailing skipper's licence. Her first circuit of Trelissick after the workshop took 1.5 hours to complete and needed lots of stops, including 4 on the hill. Now, about 3 stone lighter she can skip around Trelissick in less than an hour, do the hill without stopping (or being puce in the face) and is ready for another circuit.
			<br />Walking with Suzanne you will get lots of facts, figures, history and trivia - not all of it about boats or walking kit. She finds the sociability of walking in a small, friendly group is a great stress buster, and helps to counterbalance all those hours spent slumped over a computer in her day job. She also finds the evening walks in the dark a great antidote to the winter blues.
			<br />Suzanne has become a walk leader to ensure she continues reaping the beneficial effects of Nordic Walking through her sixth decade - yes, she really is that old -  and can continue to eat cake.
			<br />P.S. It's no use giving her any excuses for not walking - she's already used them all herself......
